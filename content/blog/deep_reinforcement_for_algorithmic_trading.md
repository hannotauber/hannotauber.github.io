## AI

>To be more precise, [Pwnagotchi](https://pwnagotchi.ai/intro/) is using an [LSTM with MLP feature extractor](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/policies.html#stable_baselines.common.policies.MlpLstmPolicy) as its policy network for the [A2C agent](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/a2c.html). If you’re unfamiliar with A2C, here is a very good [introductory explanation](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) (in comic form!) of the basic principles behind how Pwnagotchi learns. Be sure to check out the Usage doc for more pragmatic details of how to help your Pwnagotchi learn as quickly as possible.

*A2C* A synchronous, deterministic variant of Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) . It uses multiple workers to avoid the use of a replay buffer.

[A3C Abstract](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf)
> We present asynchronous variants offour standard reinforcement learning algorithmsand show that parallel actor-learners have astabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU.
